# flammenwerfer
> üî• ***Flammenwerfer*** (*flamethrower* in German), where ‚ùÑÔ∏è ***Frostbite*** meets the dance of inferno.

`flammenwerfer` is a Python package designed to provide a simple interface for modders to interact with the original Frostbite engine binaries. 

## Installation
```shell
pip install flammenwerfer
```

In case you use Poetry:
```shell
poetry add flammenwerfer
```

## Usage
The package only supports the following features now:

- `flammenwerfer.hash`: Hash functions used by the Frostbite engine. Currently, only FNV series hash functions (`flammenwerfer.hash.fnv`) are supported.
- `flammenwerfer.localization`: Interface for `Histogram` and `LocalizationBinary` files.

Currently no documentation is available since the package is still in its early stages of development. However, [BF1CHS/bf1chs](https://github.com/BF1CHS/bf1chs) (a toolbox for Simplified Chinese localization of Battlefield 1) could be checked for some examples of usage. More examples are welcomed.

## Contributing
Though the package is still in its early stages of development, [Pull Requests](https://github.com/BF1CHS/flammenwerfer/pulls) are welcome.

You can setup your own copy of the source code with Git and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```shell
# Git
git clone https://github.com/BF1CHS/flammenwerfer.git
cd flammenwerfer/

# Poetry
poetry lock
poetry install
poetry shell
```
